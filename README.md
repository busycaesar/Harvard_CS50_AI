# Harvard CS50's Introduction to AI with Python

## Description

This repository contains my notes and insights from [Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-artificial-intelligence-python). This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundational concepts of artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on practical implementations using Python.

I am following [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp)'s YouTube video to learn this course.
